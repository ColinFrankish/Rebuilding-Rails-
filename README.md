Rebuilding-Rails-
=================

Following Noah Gibbs book "Rebuilding Rails", create a gem of my own
in this case called Rulers, to mimic basic Rails functions. 

Object of the excercise is to gain a bottom-up understanding of Rails magic !

The gem will be built alongside a small app 'Best Quotes', and with a basic 
Rails app "test_app" to compare the code and functions. 

Should be fun!
